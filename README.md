This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `Bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which tries to access an array element beyond its bounds. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.  This is a great example of how off-by-one errors can lead to runtime exceptions.  Understanding array indexing is crucial for avoiding this type of error.
